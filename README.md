# StreamDeck Plugins

This repository is a central hub for the development of various Streamdeck plugins that I made for use on my personal Streamdeck. I decided to share them here with the hope that they might be useful to others. It is currently very barebones right now. More plugins will eventually be added over time.

## What's Inside?

The following plugins are available:
- [Wallpaper Engine Streamdeck Plugin](https://github.com/TWooding/streamdeck-plugins/tree/main/streamdeck-wallpaper-engine-plugin) 


## Development Status

Please be aware that all plugins in this repository are W.I.P, meaning that you may encounter bugs or unexpected behavior.
There will be changes or bugfixes here and there, but very active development is not to be expected.
